High Level Languages
    The first high leel language was FORTRAN
    Having a high level language is good, but
    the CPU does not understand them
        as shown in previous exaamples they only understand
        very basic instructions

    Simplified
        write code --> compiler --> generates assembly code
        --> assembler --> binary/machine code --> CPU (Fetch - decode
        - execute)

Why write assembly?
    many of us will have to read/write some assembly code at some point

    learning assembly makes you a better programmer in high-level languages

X86 and NASM

x86 is short for 80x86
    To learn assembly programming need to pick an ISA
    (Instruction Set Architecture)

    In the late 70s intel crates the 8088 and 8086 processors
        16 bit registers
        1 MiB of memboery, divided into 64 KiB segments

    very little fundamental changes since the creation of 8086
    x86 is very unsightly ISA, add ons vs. re-design

    to write x86 you need to know the name of the register
    8086 offers 16 bit registers.
    Four general purpose 16-bit registers
    
    AX
    BX
    CX
    DX

    each are 16 bit registers consisting of 8 low bits and 8 bits
        low least significant
        high most significant
    able to refer to each one individually
    AH, AL
    BH, BL
    CH, CL
    DH, DL

    Two 16 bit index registers
    SI
    DI

    General purpose registers
    conventially these are used to store pointers
    these general purpose pointers CANNOT be decompsed into High and
    Low bit 1-byte registers

    Two 16 bit special registers
    BP: Base Pointer
    SP: Stack Pointer
    
    Four 16-bit sement registers
    CS Code Segment
    DS Data Segment
    SS Stack Segment
    ES Extra Stack

    16 bit Instruction POinter IP register
        points to the next instruction to executre
        typically not used idrecty when writing assembly

    15 bit flasgs register
        the bits of the FLAGS contain status

    in 8086 processor a program iss lilmited to referncing an address space 
    of size 1 MiB that is 2^20 bytes

    address space has three logical regions
