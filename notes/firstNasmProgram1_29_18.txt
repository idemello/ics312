Assembly
    human shortcode for machine code
Assembler
    translates from assembly to machine code
commenting codes in assembly is essential
    recommends commenting every line of assembler
    in NASM ; is a comment
    anything to the right of a ; is a comment
    for example:
        add eax, ebx    ; y = y + b

Assembly directives 
    %define is a macro
        for example
            %define SIZE 100
    also works with includes
        %include "some_file"

    #define when possible to avoid code duplication
